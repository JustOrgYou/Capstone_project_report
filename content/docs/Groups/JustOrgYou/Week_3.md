## Prototype Features

The prototype features section showcases the progress made during the third week
of development. This week proved to be highly productive, with the successful
implementation of various features and functionalities.

During this phase of development, the team accomplished the following key milestones:

- Successfully completed the development of a **mobile app**, which effectively
  incorporates its underlying business logic template and seamlessly integrates
  a NoSQL database.
- Implemented the essential elements of the mobile app's **user interface**,
  ensuring a solid foundation for further interface enhancements.
- Adapted the **Figma design** to facilitate ongoing UI development, allowing
  for a streamlined and consistent visual experience.
- The team successfully implemented the **core data structures** of the Todo
  Library in Rust, which will serve as the foundation for the library's API.
- Conducted a proof-of-concept validation of an ability to run **Rust on
  mobile** devices, paving the way for potential future utilization of Rust's
  capabilities.
- Established a minimum viable product (MVP) **backend**, laying the groundwork
  for further scalability and functionality.
- Developed a **machine learning** component specifically designed for searching
  and discovering similar tasks, enhancing the app's overall intelligence and
  user interaction.

### Todo library

In our Todo Library we have successfully implemented the main data structures
that will function as the API for external interactions. As mentioned earlier,
we take [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) as a basis. Despite the fact that Org
Mode doesn't have any specification, we've investigated all the related
documentation and source of initial implementation for Emacs and one of the
[Orgzly App](https://orgzly.com/). Additionally, we have conducted successful
tests to validate the feasibility of executing Rust code from Flutter using Rust
bindings.

### Backend

We have achieved the MVP state for the backend, establishing a master backend
(facade) that offers a REST API for client interactions. Our design effectively
isolates the machine learning (ML) component from direct requests, enabling us
to separate changes in the AI aspect from the client and vice versa. This
isolation simplifies the deployment of resource-intensive services as separate
entities and sets the stage for future blue-green deployment processes.

The main prototype feature we've implemented is a two ready-to-use API services (ML & Master), with provided Swagger docs:

### Mobile app

Our desired approach follows an "offline first" strategy, which emphasizes the
importance of the database as a starting point. While this is indeed true, it is
essential to abstract the business logic from the database. To achieve this, we
initially focused on defining application-specific models that are utilized
throughout all internal components. Furthermore, we developed a simple user
interface that enables seamless interaction on mobile devices. Subsequently, we
conducted tests with various databases and found that
[Isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar) provided an excellent
development experience and cross-platform compatibility. However, to maintain
flexibility and the possibility of changing our database choice in the future,
we implemented an abstraction layer.

## User Interface

We have recently updated our [Figma
Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/gc679jQhRxzZi29xVcwOO0/ui-workflow?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design),
which can be accessed at this link. In order to prioritize the essential
features for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we intentionally focused more on
enhancing the user experience (UX) rather than dedicating efforts to styling at
this stage. However, we have plans to incorporate the style we developed, which can be
previewed
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/gc679jQhRxzZi29xVcwOO0/ui-workflow?type=design&node-id=108-2&mode=design).
To better understand the primary mechanics, envision an app similar to Tinder,
but designed specifically for organizing tasks. Due to the considerable time
required to fully implement it in Figma, we have established the basics and
entrusted the further development to our mobile developers. Please anticipate
future updates for a clearer understanding of the design.

Let's take a moment to explore the progress made within the app. Please refer to

## Challenges and Solutions

The development process encountered various challenges that required innovative
solutions and problem-solving. In this section, we will discuss the obstacles
faced during the project's execution and provide insights into the strategies
employed to overcome them.

One of the primary challenges we encountered was the complexity of
running Rust on mobile devices. Initially, we underestimated the intricacies
involved in this process. Currently, linking the necessary components for app
publishing is a laborious and manual task. To address this, we plan to introduce
scripts to streamline the process and explore the integration of Continuous
Integration (CI) methods for improved efficiency. Additionally, we aim to
mitigate the impact of direct native dependencies on the app by creating a
separate package specifically designed for this purpose. Although this challenge
has presented difficulties, it is worth noting that it is one of several
obstacles we have encountered, and we are actively working towards finding
suitable solutions.

Initially, our team faced a lack of synchronization and a lack of clarity
regarding each team member's contributions and understanding of the project. To
address this issue, we organized a meeting dedicated to resolving these
challenges. During the meeting, we collectively agreed to hold regular meetings
twice a week to improve communication and ensure a shared understanding of the
app's architecture, purpose, and concept. As a result, our meetings now follow a
structured approach where we begin by discussing completed tasks and then
collaboratively determine the next steps. Additionally, we encourage the
exploration of new ideas, such as delving deeper into the concept of swiping,
which led to the innovative "wheels" solution for a specific problem. These
measures have greatly enhanced our team's cohesion and productivity.

During the development of the Rust module architecture and core data structures,
which depend on the Org Mode file format, we encountered a challenge in
obtaining a comprehensive specification for this format. The primary source of
information available was the original implementation's source code, written in
Lisp as an Emacs plugin. However, we discovered that other developers had
previously attempted to reimplement Org Mode parsers in different programming
languages, such as the implementation found in the Orgzly mobile app. We
examined their approach to task and repeating dateTime formats to inform our own
implementation within the library.

Due to the lack of design expertise within our team, we encountered challenges in developing a prototype that is both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Consequently, we sought assistance from a known designer to address this predicament. In the upcoming week, we anticipate incorporating her recommendations into the design of our application.

## Next Steps

Our next steps involve updating the user interface (UI) to address a few
identified bugs and begin implementing the primary mechanics of the application.
As the necessary components are already in place, we anticipate this task to be
relatively straightforward.

Additionally, we aim to address the challenges
associated with native code updates, which can be quite complex but not
immediately critical. We have allocated a two-week timeframe to tackle this
aspect of the project, allowing us to ensure a smoother and more efficient
development process.

Our backend has reached a stable state where we no longer face limitations.
Therefore, in the upcoming week, our developer will focus on assisting with the
todo library. This collaboration will not only accelerate the overall
development process but also reduce the [bus
factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor), ensuring that knowledge and
expertise are shared among team members. Additionally, we have planned some
minor changes to incorporate an authentication process for the mobile app. These
enhancements will enhance the security and usability of the application.
