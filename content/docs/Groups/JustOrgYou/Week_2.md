## Architecture

### Component Breakdown

The diagram below depicts the architecture of our application:

![](/JustOrgYou/week2/sequence_diagram.png)

There are 4 main components that are divided into 2 groups: local and
server-side.

Local:
- **Todo Library** contains main business logic of our app. It is responsible
  for parsing collections of todo entries and performing actions with them.
  Actions include quering, modifying, merging, performing any user-defined
  functions (i.e plugins written in rust for any automated data manipulation).
- **Frontend clients** are responsible only for representation of the data,
  OS-specific actions and communication with the server everything else is
  delegated to **Todo Library**.

Server-side:
- **API server** is used to handle communication of the client-side application
  with everything else. The main purpose of it is to be in the middle between
  **Frontend** and **AI models**, but in future it may be extended for more
  complex actions (e.g. communication with remote database)
- **AI models** are a set of different algorithms that would perform advanced
  automation actions like searching by meaning, automatic merge-conflict
  resolution and so on.

### Data Management

We are developing open source app, so we strongly respect user privacy. Main
functionality is available without network access, since all data is stored
locally on user device. For this purpose we are going to use NoSQL solutions
Isar or Hive as supplement to the plain text files. Server part only perform ML
actions, so we store credentials and user specific data in MongoDB. Temporal
storage is done in memory.

#### Data Storage

One of the main goals of our project is to be as future proof and open as
possible, thus all data related to tasks will be stored in plain text files.
Initially we will be using [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/index.html) format for
that but with the possibility of adding new modules to support other file types
or even databases.

And the main issue with plain text storage is not the size of files and thus
speed of their processing (as our calculations suggest even having 10,000 tasks
in a single file which is a really huge number, we would occupy only a few MB)
but file edits by external sources while the app is running and conflicting
versions of the same file.

Usually this kind of problems are handled by DBMS, however, we don't want to use
them for the reasons described earlier. To solve this issue we are planning to
implement a smart merging tool for tasks. It would not only be useful inside our
project, but also provide a handy way to resolve synchronization conflicts while
using multiple devices + some way to synchronize them (e.g. cloud storage like
DropBox or peer to peer solutions like Syncthing).

#### Task Data Model

`Task` is the smallest core unit in our application. As an inspiration and
guidelines we used [Org Mode's TODO item](https://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-Items.html).
It contains the following fields(note that here `field_name: Type` notation is
used):

- `title: Line` a single line describing a task, usually it's enough to use only
  it without a body.
- `body: String` a multi line string that may contain anything, including
  tables, code blocks and so on.
- `children: Collection[Task]` a group of tasks each of which is a child of the
  current note in the tree hierarchy.
- `priority: Option[Unsigned Integer]` a priority indicator. The lower the number, the
  higher the priority (0 - highest priority). It is usually displayed as A, B or
  C in most todo apps.
- `keyword: Word` a property that indicates state of the task. Usually it has
  only 2 states: TODO and DONE. But in GTD there are other states such as
  SOMEDAY and INBOX.
- `tags: Collection[Word]` a collection of tags, that are usually used to
  simplify searching for the information.
- `scheduled: Option[PeriodicDateTime]` a periodic date time that represents when you are going to do this task.
- `deadline: Option[PeriodicDateTime]` a periodic date time that represents when the deadline for the task.
- `properties: Collection[String]` a list of other properties, that may be used
  to extend task management system.

Note that the following types are used as supporting ones:

- `PeriodicDateTime` is a type for scheduling events. It is a point in time that
  can be repeated. Refer to the
  [Deadlines and Scheduling](https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-Scheduling.html)
  and [Repeated tasks](https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html).
- `Option[T]` is a container that may contain some value of type `T` or `None`. It
  is used to signify presence/absence of something.
- `Collection[T]` is a container containing a group of elements.
- `Word` is a `String` without white space characters in it.
- `Line` is a `String` without linebreaks in it.

#### Notebook Data Model

`Notebook` is simply a collection of tasks and is represented by a single file

- `tasks: Collection[Task]` are all the top-level tasks in a file.
- `keywords: Collection[Keywords]` are [per file keywords](https://orgmode.org/manual/Per_002dfile-keywords.html).

### UI Design

You can view our workflow and design
[mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/gc679jQhRxzZi29xVcwOO0/ui-workflow?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=VvQUyZVxJ5F6pY9s-1).

Here are main points and decisions of our design:

- Seamless and Non-disruptive UI: Design a distraction-free interface for adding
  tasks without interrupting workflow.
- Simplified and Efficient Sorting Process: Optimize task sorting using 
  drag-and-drop options.
- Consistent Cross-Platform Experience: Ensure a consistent UX across desktop
  and mobile platforms.
- Offline Functionality and Reliability: Allow offline task management with
  automatic syncing.
- Mobile Inbox Processing: Design a mobile-friendly interface for efficient task
  processing on mobile devices.
- Performance and Speed: Optimize app performance for smooth and responsive user
  experience.
- Integration-Friendly Design: Enable integration with various task management
  systems and offer import/export options.

### Integration and APIs

We currently don't have any integrations with external services. Our
architecture primarily revolves around internal components and modules that work
together seamlessly to deliver the intended functionality. As our To-do app
evolves, we remain open to exploring opportunities for integrating with external
services when it aligns with our objectives and security considerations.

### Scalability and Performance

Scalability and performance are crucial factors to consider when designing the architecture of a software solution. Here are some techniques to achieve
scalability and optimize performance, that we plan to use in our project:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
    First and most common approach is to scale horizontally by adding more instances to distribute the workload.
    In our project architecture, we plan to introduce this technique for a service, responsible for ML and master backend service (Python), which are the only 2 types of services, in our microservice-like architecture.
2. **Asynchronous programming**
    By offloading time-consuming tasks to background processes or queues, we will improve the responsiveness of our system. Processing events asynchronosuly allows the main application on server to handle IO-bound requests quickly, comparing to thos in **synchronous programming**.
3. **Modularity and Microservices**
    We further enhance scalability, development, and maintenance by dividing our project's logic into modular components that are not dependent on each other: Rust todo library, AI's related service, master backend server, frontend client. 
    The microservices architecture enables independent development, deployment, reusability and scalability of specific components, ensuring fault isolation and better overall system performance.

### Security and Privacy


Security and privacy are top priorities for our team in developing our project. We have taken several measures to ensure the protection of user data:

1. **HTTPS-only connection**
    Firstly, our Web client would allow connections only via HTTPS, which will ensure security of transferring data via Internet.
2. **No sensitive data storage**
    We do not ask any sensitive information from our clients, such as name, date of birth, to minimize the risks associated with data leakage.
3. **Encryption of data**
    Secondly, we will use encryption and hashing algorithms for saving user passwords, which should help avoid data leakage in case of hacking.
4. **Synchronization with server is optional**
    Our application offers users the freedom to choose whether they want to synchronize their data with a remote cloud server.
    Cloud-dependent features like **ML** (Machine learning) and Account synchronization are available but not mandatory, base functionality goes **offline** and covers most of user needs.
5. **Attack-resistant SSH**
    As for our servers, we will use ssh keys for connection, denying use of passwords, as it is vulnerable to attaks.


### Error Handling and Resilience

There are many techniques we are planning to use in our project to avoid errors
and unexpected bugs. By incorporating these robust error handling and resilience
techniques, we improve the reliability of our software, minimize downtime, and
deliver a more seamless user experience. These practices contribute to the
overall quality and stability of our application, ensuring it can handle
unexpected situations and recover gracefully from failures.

1. **Graceful Error Handling**: We design our application to handle errors
   gracefully by providing meaningful error messages to users. Clear and
   informative error messages enable users to understand what went wrong and
   take appropriate actions. We avoid exposing sensitive information in error
   messages to maintain security.
2. **Exception Handling**: We use exception handling techniques to catch and
   handle runtime errors in a structured manner. By catching exceptions at
   appropriate levels in our application's code, we can prevent unhandled
   exceptions from crashing the system and provide alternative paths or recovery
   options
3. **Immutability**: Making majority of variables immutable (meaning that after
   the value is assigned it cannot be changed) provides another layer of
   security. Firstly, concurrency becomes very convenient as we don't have to
   think about concurrent read/write operations which is the main problem when
   creating such apps. Secondly, it's harder to make mistakes when knowing
   that somewhere along the way the data won't be be changed (contrary, when
   using mutable variable and passing it around to some functions, programmer
   can't be sure if the function produces only result or also changes the
   variable).
   For mobile application we split mutable (state) and immutable (data) layers,
   so user interface could only ask state manager to perfrom action that updates
   data. Afterwards, UI will get updates reactively. Yes, internally this
   approach involve side effects, but they are highly isolated from other system.
4. **Type-level errors**: Rich type systems allow encoding error information
   into the type signature, which is a lot more secure and clearer than throwing
   errors and hoping that they will be handled appropriately. For example,
   `Option[T]` described earlier is a lot better than using error codes (such as
   -1 in many C/C++ applications) or null values because some functions are
   always returning a value and some may return null. The same concept is used
   in mobile app because dart offer nullable types and they are explicitly
   differ from non-nullable, `String?` is not `String`.
5. **Borrow checker**: It is another concept which ensures security in terms of memory
   manipulations. If variable(or reference) is immutable, then there aren't any
   restrictions on reading it, but if variable(or reference) is mutable, then
   only 1 piece of code(usually function) can use it and others can't unit this
   piece of code has finished. Also if the variable is not used and won't be
   used any more it is freed, which ensures that there are no memory leaks.
6. **App global error handler** this part is specific for GUI clients, like mobile
   app. Because, user couldn't be notified as easy as in terminal, we want to reduce
   uncaugh errors. But sometimes, exception raises from dependency in example and
   developer just could not predict user environment setup and depdendency behavior.
   So, to not ignore exception nor fall the app, we handle all such cases globally
   and navigate user to special screen similar to "oops, error ... occured".
7. **Separation of Logic into Services and Modules**
    We adopt a modular approach by separating the application's logic into different services that communicate with each other, instead of running the whole logic on single host. This architectural design ensures that if one part of the application fails, it does not result in a complete system failure.
    Moreover, we will use separate **Rust** library, that will handle tasks representation and modification. This library will run on both client & server, which helps incapsulate common logic in different places. 

#### Network related errors

Also, we recognize the importance of error handling and resilience especially in
the context of our microservices architecture. With modules distributed across
different hosts communicating with each other via APIs, we place special
emphasis on addressing errors related to API interactions, such as serialization
and validation. Here's how we address these specific aspects:

1. **Serialization Errors**: We ensure that data serialization between microservices
   is handled correctly to prevent errors during the conversion of data
   structures into a format suitable for transmission. We follow best practices
   and use well-established serialization techniques, such as JSON or Protocol
   Buffers, to ensure compatibility and minimize the chances of
   serialization-related errors.
2. **Validation Errors**: We pay close attention to data validation within our APIs
   to maintain data integrity and prevent invalid or inconsistent data from
   entering the system. We implement robust validation mechanisms at both the
   API input and output levels, verifying that the received data adheres to
   expected formats, constraints, and business rules. By validating inputs and
   outputs, we can catch errors early and provide informative error messages to
   guide users and developers in resolving any issues.
3. **Error Responses and Status Codes**: In our API design, we establish a
   consistent approach to error responses and status codes. We define clear
   conventions for communicating errors, including appropriate HTTP status
   codes, standardized error payloads, and error message formats. Consistency in
   error responses helps in understanding and handling errors effectively, both
   within our microservices ecosystem and for external consumers of our APIs.

By considering these aspects within our microservices-like architecture, we
effectively address errors related to API interactions. We prioritize proper
serialization and validation to maintain data integrity and compatibility. These
practices contribute to the overall stability, reliability, and resilience of
our microservices ecosystem.

### Deployment and DevOps

For the deployment and DevOps practices of our project, we will follow a set of
strategies and use appropriate tools to ensure smooth and efficient deployment
processes. Some key considerations and actions include:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    We will implement a continuous integration (CI) to automate the build, testing (unit-testing, integration tests, and others) , and deployment processes. This will allows us to catch bugs early, ensure code stability, and support confident deployments. Most probably we will use **Github Actions**.
    For **Python**, we will use such tools: `isort`, `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`. All of them help identifying bugs, code smells, and unexpected behaviours in our programs.
2. **Continuous deployment (CD)**:
    Continious deployment is also important part of slim and up-to-date application, it will help us deliver updates on time, according to a given action pattern.
    Also will be implemented via **Github Actions**.
3. **Containerization (Docker)**: We will utilize containerization technology, especially **Docker**, to package our application and its dependencies into lightweight and portable containers.
    This approach enables consistent deployment across different environments and simplifies the management of dependencies.

By incorporating these deployment and DevOps practices, we aim to achieve
efficient, reliable, and scalable deployments while maintaining a robust
development workflow and ensuring the stability and performance of our
application.
