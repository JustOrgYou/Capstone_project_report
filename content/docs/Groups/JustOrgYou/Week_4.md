  - [x] Eliminate mistakes(if any) by utilizing the iterative approach during the early
        stages of the project


During Week 4 of our Capstone Project, we focused on gathering feedback and conducting testing to improve our app. Here is a summary of our progress:

## External Feedback

To gather feedback, we asked a group of our friends to test our app. Overall, they liked the app and found it promising. However, one consistent feedback point was that the visual user interface (UI) looks "like a skelet". But overall UX ideas were enjoyed. So, aggregated recommendations from the test group are: add customization from swipe directions in app and plan to setup beauty.

We highly value this feedback as it highlights an area for improvements and we are really satisfied that key concept is valuable. During next week we plan integrate settings for swipes and to focus on refining the UI/UX to enhance the user experience and ensure that our app is both functional and visually appealing.

## Testing and Narrowing The Scope

We conducted testing on two main components of our project:
- **Flutter** front-end part
    Feedback showed that main idea has potential and our initial direction was correct enough. Also, we get suggestion feature called mandatory for project being. We agreed with testers, so soon enough we are going to implement it.
- The APIs services on the backend.
    Additionally, we rigorously tested our APIs on the backend to ensure their reliability and proper communication between them and client part.
    Testing allowed us to address any bugs or glitches and make the necessary adjustments for a smoother user experience.

## Iteration and refinement

Taking into account the feedback we received and the results of our testing, we have decided to prioritize swipe cusomization and improving the visual UI of our app. We will work on refining the design elements, theme, and overall aesthetics to make it more user-friendly and visually pleasing. Our iterative approach allows us to incorporate feedback and continuously enhance our app, ensuring that it meets the expectations and needs of our target users. 

In conclusion, Week 4 was dedicated to gathering external feedback and conducting testing on our app. We received positive feedback from our colleagues and tested both the front-end and backend components. This allowed us to identify areas for improvement and iterate on our app to enhance its usability and functionality. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality product and will continue to incorporate feedback and conduct thorough testing in the upcoming weeks.
